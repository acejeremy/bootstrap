Melsoft boostrap project
I'll redesign the Tag Team Signs website (https://www.tagteamsigns.com/) using Bootstrap to create a more modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience. The current website has good content but could benefit from improved organization, visual hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness.

Analysis of Current Website
Strengths:
Clear business purpose (sign manufacturing)

Good information about services

Contact information is visible

Examples of work provided

Areas for Improvement:
Outdated design aesthetic

Poor mobile responsiveness

Lack of visual hierarchy

Minimal use of modern web components

Basic navigation without dropdowns

Limited calls to action

Could better showcase portfolio
